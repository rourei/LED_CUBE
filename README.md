## LED_Cube

This repository contains the Arduino sketch for my 3x3x3 LED Cube. You can see a video of the final working version on my Instagram profile right [here](www.instagram.com/diy_engineered).

I wanted to build a cube like this for a very long time and after getting my first soldering iron in March 2020 I immediately decided to give it a go.
I checked out a few tutorials on YouTube and combined all the things I learned and liked into my own prototype.
Since I am an absolute beginner when it comes to soldering the cube turned out a little skewed - nevertheless I am really happy with the result.
I definitely plan to build a bigger (and improved) version some time in the future!
Below you can find an image of just the LED cube on the board and another one of the bottom of the board. I think the solder straps turned out pretty well.
